# Smert

## Why?
I am dum, but wish to be smert.

## What?
`smert` is a culture server whose job is to make a daily selection of:
- A word, and its definition
- A quote
- An artwork
from a list curated that I will curate, and serve it to me over various channels so that I may come to approximate something like an education.

Currently, smert can store quotes and display one on an aesthetic web page, which I have assigned to my New Tab page in chrome via the [Custom New Tab URL
](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) extension.
More channels are expected to follow.

## How?
`smert` is written in Rust and uses Anxum as a web server with askama for templating.
